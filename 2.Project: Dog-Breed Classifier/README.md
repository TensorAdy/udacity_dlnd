## Project Overview
Given an image of a dog, you will need to implement the algorithm that will identify an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the algorithim will identify the resembling dog breed.

We need to utilize CNN model to build this classifier from scratch as well as utilize pretrained models for transfer learning. I have utilized resnet50
