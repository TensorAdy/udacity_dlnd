## Project Overview
Given an image of a dog, you will need to implement the algorithm that will identify an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the algorithim will identify the resembling dog breed.

We need to utilize CNN model to build this classifier from scratch as well as utilize pretrained models for transfer learning. I have utilized resnet50 for teh pretrained model part

#### Implementation details 

Details of the implementation can be found in the Jupyter notebook [dog_app.ipynb](https://github.com/TensorAdy/udacity_dlnd/blob/master/2.Project:%20Dog-Breed%20Classifier/dog_app.ipynb) 
 
Report in the PDF format is availabe [here](https://github.com/TensorAdy/udacity_dlnd/blob/master/2.Project:%20Dog-Breed%20Classifier/dog_app.pdf)

both can also be accessed from the Project: Dog-Breed Classifier
